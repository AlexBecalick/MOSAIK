abstract={Many biological applications require the segmentation of cell bodies, membranes and nuclei from microscopy images. Deep learning has enabled great progress on this problem, but current methods are specialized for images that have large training datasets. Here we introduce a generalist, deep learning-based segmentation method called Cellpose, which can precisely segment cells from a wide range of image types and does not require model retraining or parameter adjustments. Cellpose was trained on a new dataset of highly varied images of cells, containing over 70,000 segmented objects. We also demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) extension of Cellpose that reuses the two-dimensional (2D) model and does not require 3D-labeled data. To support community contributions to the training data, we developed software for manual labeling and for curation of the automated results. Periodically retraining the model on the community-contributed data will ensure that Cellpose improves constantly.},

abstract={Spatially resolved omics technologies are transforming our understanding of biological tissues. However, the handling of uni- and multimodal spatial omics datasets remains a challenge owing to large data volumes, heterogeneity of data types and the lack of flexible, spatially aware data structures. Here we introduce SpatialData, a framework that establishes a unified and extensible multiplatform file-format, lazy representation of larger-than-memory data, transformations and alignment to common coordinate systems. SpatialData facilitates spatial annotations and cross-modal aggregation and analysis, the utility of which is illustrated in the context of multiple vignettes, including integrative analysis on a multimodal Xenium and Visium breast cancer study.},

In this Review, we highlight advances in the fast-developing field of single-cell and spatial multi-omics technologies (also known as multimodal omics approaches), and the computational strategies needed to integrate information across these molecular layers.

Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) experiments quantify the copy number and location of mRNA molecules; however, the numbers of RNA species that can be simultaneously measured by smFISH has been limited. Using combinatorial labeling with error-robust encoding schemes, Chen et al. simultaneously imaged 100 to 1000 RNA species in a single cell. Such large-scale detection allows regulatory interactions to be analyzed at the transcriptome scale. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aaa6090 A single-molecule imaging method allows simultaneous measurement of 1000 RNA species in single cells. Knowledge of the expression profile and spatial landscape of the transcriptome in individual cells is essential for understanding the rich repertoire of cellular behaviors. Here, we report multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging approach that allows the copy numbers and spatial localizations of thousands of RNA species to be determined in single cells. Using error-robust encoding schemes to combat single-molecule labeling and detection errors, we demonstrated the imaging of 100 to 1000 distinct RNA species in hundreds of individual cells. Correlation analysis of the {\textasciitilde}104 to 106 pairs of genes allowed us to constrain gene regulatory networks, predict novel functions for many unannotated genes, and identify distinct spatial distribution patterns of RNAs that correlate with properties of the encoded proteins.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is presently the most predominant tumor type and the second leading cause of tumor-related deaths among women. Although advancements in diagnosis and therapeutics have momentously improved, chemoresistance remains an important challenge. Tumors oppose chemotherapeutic agents through a variety of mechanisms, with studies revealing that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is central to this process. The components of TME including stromal cells, immune cells, and non-stromal factors on exposure to chemotherapy promote the acquisition of resistant phenotype. Consequently, limited targeting of tumor cells leads to tumor recurrence after chemotherapy. Here, in this article, we summarize how TME alters chemotherapy responses in breast cancer. Furthermore, the role of different stromal cells viz., CAFs, TAMs, MSCs, endothelial cells, and cancer stem cells (CSC) in breast cancer chemoresistance is discussed in greater detail.},

abstract={Single-cell and spatial technologies that profile gene expression across a whole tissue are revolutionizing the resolution of molecular states in clinical samples. Current commercially available technologies provide whole transcriptome single-cell, whole transcriptome spatial, or targeted in situ gene expression analysis. Here, we combine these technologies to explore tissue heterogeneity in large, FFPE human breast cancer sections. This integrative approach allowed us to explore molecular differences that exist between distinct tumor regions and to identify biomarkers involved in the progression towards invasive carcinoma. Further, we study cell neighborhoods and identify rare boundary cells that sit at the critical myoepithelial border confining the spread of malignant cells. Here, we demonstrate that each technology alone provides information about molecular signatures relevant to understanding cancer heterogeneity; however, it is the integration of these technologies that leads to deeper insights, ushering in discoveries that will progress oncology research and the development of diagnostics and therapeutics.},

abstract={Single-cell spatial transcriptomics promises a highly detailed view of a cell's transcriptional state and microenvironment, yet inaccurate cell segmentation can render these data murky by misattributing large numbers of transcripts to nearby cells or conjuring nonexistent cells. We adopt methods from ab initio cell simulation, in a method called Proseg (probabilistic segmentation), to rapidly infer morphologically plausible cell boundaries. Benchmarking applied to datasets generated by three commercial platforms shows superior performance and computational efficiency of Proseg when compared to existing methods. We show that improved accuracy in cell segmentation aids greatly in detection of difficult-to-segment tumor-infiltrating immune cells such as neutrophils and T cells. Last, through improvements in our ability to delineate subsets of tumor-infiltrating T cells, we show that CXCL13-expressing CD8+ T cells tend to be more closely associated with tumor cells than their CXCL13-negative counterparts in data generated from samples from patients with renal cell carcinoma.},

	abstract = {Modern algorithms for biological segmentation can match inter-human agreement in annotation quality. This however is not a performance bound: a hypothetical human-consensus segmentation could reduce error rates in half. To obtain a model that generalizes better we adapted the pretrained transformer backbone of a foundation model (SAM) to the Cellpose framework. The resulting Cellpose-SAM model substantially outperforms inter-human agreement and approaches the human-consensus bound. We increase generalization performance further by making the model robust to channel shuffling, cell size, shot noise, downsampling, isotropic and anisotropic blur. The new model can be readily adopted into the Cellpose ecosystem which includes finetuning, human-in-the-loop training, image restoration and 3D segmentation approaches. These properties establish Cellpose-SAM as a foundation model for biological segmentation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute, https://ror.org/006w34k90,},
